# PowerBIDashboards for PwC Switzerland PowerBI virtual Program on Forage-July 2023
I built dashboards on three Datasets provided by PwC Switzerland clients on PowerBI Virtual Program on Forage. Derived many hidden insights into the datasets, some of the top ones are- Monthly and Yearly Loss of clients due to Customer Churn(Dataset-Customer Churn) and Women in Executive Management positions are less likely to leave the company as compared to Men(Dataset-Diversity & Inclusion).

Below are the Screenshots of the Dashboard for Insights in the diversity of the Executive suite(Dataset-Diversity and inclusion)
